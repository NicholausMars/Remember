I have been applying for local companies and they reject me for internship and as well as full time position. While everyone spent their summer break learning at companies I learn at my home on my laptop and then something happen.
 I apply for my dream company and I took a challenge. Someone close to me died on 17th and i was crying throw the night. Then the next day i get a congratulation you have made it throw the first round from my dream company. What do you think i did? I cry study. I was sad but i wanted this opportunity that i know wont come again if i failed. I studied for him and i study for everyone back home. Not telling them about it.
